The healthcare sector is a critical aspect of society aimed at improving the well-being of individuals and communities. Various stakeholders, including healthcare providers, patients, policymakers, and pharmaceutical companies, play significant roles in shaping healthcare outcomes. Advancements in medical technology, research, and healthcare delivery systems continually influence the healthcare landscape, striving to enhance patient outcomes, accessibility, and cost containment.

Recent efforts have been made to improve connectivity between patients and healthcare providers, yet challenges persist in patient care, including access, coordination, quality assurance, cost management, health information management, and patient engagement. A survey conducted among patients highlights these ongoing issues.

Despite the widespread adoption of electronic health record (EHR) systems and the rise of mobile health applications, gaps remain in healthcare systems. There's a growing need for patient-centric approaches, empowering patients, enhancing engagement, and delivering personalized care.

The project outlined aims to address these gaps by creating a platform that standardizes data exchange among healthcare providers, promoting transparency and efficiency. Through patient-centric platforms, interoperability solutions, and telemedicine infrastructure, the project seeks to contribute to the evolution of healthcare, ultimately striving for a system that is convenient, affordable, and excels in patient care.
