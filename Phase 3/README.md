The key features and major constraints in the development and implementation of a Patient Care System in the healthcare sector, along with how these features are aligned to address the constraints.

Key Features:

Electronic Health Records (EHR): Enables the maintenance of digital patient records, including medical history, diagnoses, medications, and test results.
Appointment Scheduling: Allows patients to efficiently schedule appointments with healthcare providers, reducing no-show rates.
Billing and Insurance Management: Facilitates the management of patient billing, insurance claims, and reimbursement processes.
Major Constraints:

Budgetary Constraints: Limited resources may affect system features, customization, and ongoing support.
Technical Infrastructure: Availability and scalability of technical resources can impact system capabilities and performance.
Vendor Lock-In: Reliance on a single vendor may limit flexibility, interoperability, and cost-effectiveness.
Alignment of Features and Constraints:
The features of the Patient Care System are designed to address the constraints. For instance, appointment scheduling and electronic health records streamline processes, reducing the burden on limited budgets and technical infrastructure. Additionally, the system aims to avoid vendor lock-in by offering flexibility and interoperability.

Overall Objective:
The goal is to build a reliable, cost-effective, and efficient Patient Care System that enhances the overall healthcare system. By addressing the identified constraints through appropriate features, the system aims to be trustworthy and increase efficiency in healthcare delivery.
